# RE Analyzer Extension - Critical Fixes Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of critical fixes for the RE Analyzer Chrome extension as outlined in the `15-EXTENSION_FIXES_CODEGEN.md` document.

## Issues Addressed

### ✅ Issue 1: Pending Status Persistence
**Problem**: Pending status doesn't remain on screen while property analysis is in progress.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added `updatePendingAnalysisInProperties()` method to show pending analysis in Properties tab
- Created `addPendingPropertyToDisplay()` to add visual pending indicators
- Added `removePendingPropertyFromDisplay()` to clean up completed analyses
- Enhanced progress tracking with real-time UI updates
- Added shimmer animation for pending property cards
- Implemented analysis spinner for visual feedback

**Key Files Modified**: `content.js`, `embedded-styles.css`

### ✅ Issue 2: Auto-switch to Properties Tab
**Problem**: After analysis completion, UI doesn't automatically switch to Properties tab.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Enhanced `completeAnalysis()` method to respect `uiSettings.autoShow` setting
- Added property data refresh after analysis completion
- Implemented `onAnalysisCompleted()` callback system for external notifications
- Added proper timing delays to ensure smooth transitions
- Integrated with both regular and split-prompt analysis workflows

**Key Files Modified**: `content.js`

### ✅ Issue 3: Property Display Data Enhancement
**Problem**: Property cards show generic information instead of meaningful property details.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Completely rewrote `getPropertyTitle()` method to prioritize extracted data
- Now displays: Address → Bedrooms → Price → Neighborhood in order of priority
- Falls back to URL parsing if no extracted data available
- Enhanced property cards to show meaningful information from analysis
- Added proper formatting for property details

**Key Files Modified**: `content.js`

### ✅ Issue 4: View Analysis and Export Button Functionality
**Problem**: "View Analysis" and "Export" buttons not working properly.

**Solution Implemented**:

#### View Analysis Button:
- Fixed `viewProperty()` method with comprehensive error handling
- Enhanced `showAnalysisModal()` with rich data display
- Added formatted property details grid
- Implemented full analysis text formatting
- Added modal styles with responsive design
- Included copy-to-clipboard functionality

#### Export Button:
- Implemented `exportProperty()` for individual property export
- Enhanced `exportAllProperties()` for bulk export
- Added JSON format export with comprehensive data
- Included proper error handling and user feedback
- Added download functionality with unique filenames

**Key Files Modified**: `content.js`, `embedded-styles.css`

### ✅ Issue 5: Custom Prompt Editing Restoration
**Problem**: Custom prompt editing functionality was missing from settings.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added complete custom prompt section to settings HTML
- Implemented `setupCustomPromptEvents()` for event handling
- Added `loadCustomPrompt()`, `saveCustomPrompt()`, `resetCustomPrompt()` methods
- Included prompt preview functionality with modal display
- Added proper validation and error handling
- Integrated with existing prompt system
- Added variable replacement preview ({PROPERTY_URL}, {DATE})

**Key Files Modified**: `content.js`
