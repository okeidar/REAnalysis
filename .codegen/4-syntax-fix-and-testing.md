# Context
The ChatGPT Helper Extension had a critical syntax error causing "Unexpected end of input" that prevented it from loading. After the merge fix, there was still a duplicate function definition issue that needed to be resolved.

# Issue Fixed (January 2025)

## Critical Syntax Error
- **Problem**: `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input` at popup.js:750
- **Root Cause**: Duplicate `initializePopup` function definitions (lines 509 and 678)
- **Impact**: Extension completely failed to load

## Solution Applied
- ✅ Removed duplicate `initializePopup` function definition
- ✅ Cleaned up redundant code blocks
- ✅ Ensured proper function structure and closing braces
- ✅ Reduced file size from 769 to 653 lines (116 lines removed)
