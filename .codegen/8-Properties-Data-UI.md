# Context
The Chrome extension needs a comprehensive UI system for displaying Properties data that is extracted from ChatGPT responses. The current implementation shows basic property information in a simple list format, but users need a more sophisticated interface to view, compare, and interact with detailed property analysis data. The UI should provide multiple viewing modes, data organization, and interactive features for effective property evaluation and comparison.

- **Interactive Features**: Allow users to edit, compare, and export property data
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear presentation of data importance and relationships
- **Responsive Design**: Adapt to different screen sizes and popup constraints
- **Data Validation**: Show confidence indicators and data quality metrics
- **Export Integration**: Seamless connection with Excel export functionality
- **Real-time Updates**: Reflect changes in data extraction and user modifications
