# Context:
We have multiple analysis mode (default, dynamic, tabular, custom). We want to have only the default mode and allow csv export for it.

# Requirements:
- Remove the dynamic, tabular, and custom modes.
- Keep the default mode.
- Allow csv export for the default mode.
- Do not remove any other code.
- Do not change how the default mode works.

# Tasks:
- [ ] Remove the dynamic, tabular, and custom modes.
- [ ] Allow csv export for the default mode.
- [ ] Make sure the code and the default mode are working as expected (Default mode unchanged).
