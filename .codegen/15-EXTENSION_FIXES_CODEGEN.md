# RE Analyzer Extension - Critical Fixes Codegen

## Overview
This codegen file addresses the following critical issues with the RE Analyzer Chrome extension:

1. **Pending status doesn't remain on screen while property analysis hasn't been extracted yet**
2. **After analysis was extracted the analyzed property is not immediately shown on the Properties tab automatically**
3. **The data presented as the property first impression on the Properties tab is not the address or number of bedrooms**
4. **The "view analysis" button and the "export" button don't work**
5. **The option to edit the automatic prompt was available before but is gone now**

## Issue Analysis

### Issue 1: Pending Status Not Persistent
**Problem**: The UI doesn't properly show a persistent "pending" state for properties being analyzed.
**Root Cause**: The pending status is not properly tracked and displayed in the Properties tab.
**Solution**: Implement proper pending state management and visual indicators.

### Issue 2: Auto-switch to Properties Tab Not Working
**Problem**: After analysis completion, the UI doesn't automatically switch to the Properties tab.
**Root Cause**: The auto-switch logic is not properly triggered or the setting is not working.
**Solution**: Fix the auto-switch logic and ensure it's properly triggered.

### Issue 3: Incorrect Property Display Data
**Problem**: Property cards show generic information instead of actual property details.
**Root Cause**: The `getPropertyTitle()` function is not extracting meaningful data from the property analysis.
**Solution**: Improve property data extraction and display logic.

### Issue 4: View Analysis and Export Buttons Not Working
**Problem**: These buttons are not functioning properly.
**Root Cause**: The button event handlers are not properly implemented or the functions they call are broken.
**Solution**: Fix the button implementations and ensure proper functionality.

### Issue 5: Custom Prompt Editing Missing
**Problem**: The option to edit the automatic prompt has been removed from settings.
**Root Cause**: The custom prompt editing UI has been removed from the settings tab.
**Solution**: Restore the custom prompt editing functionality in the settings.
